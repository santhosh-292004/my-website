Personal Website

This is a simple personal website built using HTML. It consists of multiple pages that provide information about me, my interests, and my contact details.

Project Structure

The website contains the following HTML files:

index.html - Homepage with a brief introduction.

about.html - Page containing details about me.

contact.html - Page with contact information.

interest.html - Page describing my interests.

Features

Navigation menu for easy browsing between pages.

A table layout for organizing content and images.

Simple and clean design using HTML only.

Installation & Usage

Clone or download this repository.

Open any of the .html files in a web browser to view the website.

File Paths Issue

Ensure that the image file paths are correctly referenced relative to your project directory. Currently, the images are referenced using an absolute path (e.g., D:\HTML\program 2\home.jpg). Change them to relative paths (e.g., images/home.jpg) and store the images within an images folder inside your project directory.

Future Enhancements

Add CSS for better styling.

Improve responsiveness using CSS media queries.

Implement JavaScript for interactive elements.
